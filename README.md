# Machine Learning

## Charm Algorithm
This python file here may look simple; it is just over a 100 lines, there are no custom classes, and I am using basic python3 code. 
But this took me nearly two 40 hour weeks to complete! The goal of this assignment was to recreate the charm algorithm based on pseudocode from a machine learning
textbook. Again, it sounds simple, but the text was dense and complicated to understand. 

>It enumerates closed sets using a dual itemset-tidset search
>tree, using an efficient hybrid search that skips many levels. It also uses a technique called diffsets to reduce
>the memory footprint of intermediate computations. Finally it uses a fast hash-based approach to remove
>any “non-closed” sets found during computation

## Clustering
Several clustering algorithms highlighted here including K-Means and Denclue. 

## Decision Tree
Different decision tree exercises, including a fun hand drawn Gini Index!

## MLB Pitch Data
This was my final  project for this course. Like most of my final projects, I start off with ambitions of doing something great and unique. 
But I tend to run out of time in the course or am in over my head in complexity. This project was no different. But there are some highlights from this project:

### Highlights
* A block of code that acceses an API in iterations, providing some error handling. I learned a significant amount regarding APIs because of this!
* Plenty of visualizations. They aren't great visualizations but they helped me become very familiar with the Seaborn library.
* An introduction to sklearn library. I found this to be most interesting, and started to experiment with many different pieces and parts.

### Lowlights
* This class was hard, and so I struggled to stay organized. There are several notebooks that seem to do similar things or nothing at all.
* My goal for this project was to ambitious at the start, so it had to change. And it changed many times. Leading to an outcome that is muddied and inconclusive.
